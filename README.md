# Biometric-Verification
# Project Title

Building AI-based solution for Biometrics

## Summary

This project will lead to the intelligent idea of getting international students to enroll for their 'BIOMETRIC' verification from their personal systems such as laptop, smartphone, or  tablet


## Background

This idea would solve the problem of not being able to access "Visa Application Centres- VACs" during pandemics. A lot of international students are stranded and waiting for VACs to open. For the past 2 years, this problem is prevalent and is now quite frequent due to intermittent lock-downs. My personal motivation is to smooth the entire STUDent VISA application process to be artificially driven once the VISA officer has made a decision. This topic is important and also interesting, as the education sector and international students drive a large share of any country's economy

List of current issues challenges and problems faced:
* problem 1- International Students have to wait and differ their decisions on college enrollment due to PANDEMIC Biometric Centres being shut 
* problem 2- VAC's unable to handle applications to process individual biometrics due to less staffing
* problem 3- Delay in the process of VISA issuance and PASSPORT stamping


## How is it used?

The process of using the solution. In what kind of situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

VFS Global and Embassy to incorporate AI-based software that will scan retina & fingerprints from your portable home device using the APPLICATION "APP"
In situations where physical VFS or VAC centers are not able to operate.
The users are predominantly all international students/travelers
The needs to be accounted for are - Time from the registration for Biometrics and ease of processing it.
In any event, if someone can not access physical centers, this app to be downloaded and should be linked with your 'National identity".
To scan fingerprint, the app will ask you to use each finger and press it on your mobile screen until it scans for its authenticity.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data for the sources for such a solution is already available with VFS and all Embassies.
## Challenges

The only limitations and ethical considerations that should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this are 
1- Data validity.
2- Misuse of artificial products for anyone to escape their criminal records.
3- Forge data from the server and misuse it for other purposes

## What next?

For the project to grow and become an evident operational model the skills and assistance required would be :
1- Data mining.
2- Project planning.
3- Data collection and seeking approval from all high commissions.
4- High-level security for users to log in one time with a CODE and can not re-enter any data.
5- High level of governance and IT framework with strong cloud-based storage to ensure data is restricted and protected.
